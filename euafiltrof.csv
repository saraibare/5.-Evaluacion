We LOVE exploring new cities, great food, and do tons of outdoors stuff like hiking, mountain biking & snowboarding, to name a few. When we travel, we prefer to hang out with the locals and learn more about what it's like living in a particular place. Doing the touristy thing can get old. 

To get us as guests, rest assured, we treat every place we stay in like it's our own. We love cleanliness and tidyness and we have always left our accommodations in the same or better condition than when we arrived, be it a hotel, or a vacation rental. 

We had opened up our home to international students and travelers and we welcomed them like they were part of our family. We also own 2 rental properties and we consider our tenants to be our partners in taking care of our homes. Being a host and a landlord has definitely allowed us to see the airbnb home rental process from both angles. 

We believe that we what we put out in the world, is what we get back.  So we aim to treat others as we would like to be treated, and that includes having respect for other people's properties.

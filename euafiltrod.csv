I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.
